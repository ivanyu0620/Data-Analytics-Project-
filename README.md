# Data Analytics Project
This repository contains mini projects for learning and practicing data analytics skills in SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and Python.

# Tableau
For the Tableau Full Project, I created a dashboard on 2016 Seattle Airbnb data.

# PowerBI
For Power BI, I used Parallels Desktop to access Windows to download Power BI Desktop to complete the project on my Mac. Parallels Desktop provides a 14 Day Free Trial and I recommend using this to learn Power BI for Mac users. For the Full Project, I created a dashboard to analyze data from a Data Professional Survey, collected from 630 users.
